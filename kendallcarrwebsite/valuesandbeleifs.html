             <p>I’d describe myself as a down to earth person who highly enjoys quality time with friends and family. I’m your typical Type A personality, I love organizing, planning, and following a strict schedule. I’m not your spontaneous, go with the flow kind of person, but I am loyal to a T and am very determined to earn success for myself.I value my family, my friends, my faith, my happiness, and of course my dogs. I believe that in keeping these things in close proximity to my heart, I will be able to maintain happiness. Additionally, my faith guides me in all that I do, I trust that God knows what he is doing and has a plan for my life.</p>
